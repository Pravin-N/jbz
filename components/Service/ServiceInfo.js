              a more robust economy and more popularly known as the business Hub
              of the region than UAE, more importantly the emirate of Dubai
              within UAE. In the past 30 years, Dubai and inturn UAE has seen
              exponential growth in the economy that only few countries in the
              world see in the same period. Economy of Dubai is so diversified
              that even though it is oil rich, it only contributes to about 3%
              of the economy.

          Type of License and Under which Authority to get the License.
        </h4>

        <p>
          There are three distinct types of licenses offered in Dubai or any
          other emirate in UAE. You could apply for a commercial license,
          professional license or a industrial license depending on the business
          activity to be conducted. Another important consideration is to
          determine the where to register your business in UAE. There are 7
          emirates and each emirate has its own mainland authority and freezone
          authorities. Deciding the license type and location within UAE can be
          tedious task and could also end up being expensive if the right one is
          not chosen. We at Just Business having years of experience can help
          make this process a lot easier and cost effective for you. Get in
